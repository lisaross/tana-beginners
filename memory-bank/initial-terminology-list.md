## Notes for Guide Development

1. **Progressive disclosure approach:**
   - Start with basic terms (item, tag, link)
   - Introduce more complex terms only when needed
   - Always pair technical term with plain language alternative

2. **Terminology usage guidelines:**
   - Introduce technical term with plain language: "Items (also called nodes in Tana)"
   - After initial introduction, primarily use plain language
   - Include technical term in parentheses when helpful for reference

3. **Visual dictionary:**
   - Create screenshots with each UI element clearly labeled
   - Develop icons or visual representations for key concepts
   - Use consistent visual language throughout

4. **Analogies to refine:**
   - Find better analogies based on user interview feedback
   - Ensure analogies work across different use cases
   - Test analogies with non-technical users
