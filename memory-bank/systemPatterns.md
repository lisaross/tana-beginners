# System Patterns

## Content Architecture
The "Tana Simplified: Digital Organization for Everyone" guide follows a progressive disclosure architecture:

1. **Core Chapters Structure**
   - Each chapter builds upon previous knowledge
   - Information is presented in order of increasing complexity
   - Technical terms are introduced only after establishing context
   - Visual aids support text explanations at every step

2. **Content Organization Principles**
   - Hierarchical structure (chapters → sections → subsections)
   - Consistent formatting across all content
   - Cross-references between related sections
   - "Try This" practical exercises to reinforce concepts

## Technical Structure
- **Markdown-based**: All content written in Markdown for flexibility and portability
- **Modular organization**: Self-contained sections that can be reorganized as needed
- **Version control**: Content tracked through Git for collaborative development
- **Accessibility-focused**: Structure supports screen readers and assistive technologies

## Design Patterns
1. **Plain Language Pattern**
   - Technical terms replaced with everyday analogies
   - Complex concepts broken down into relatable parts
   - 8th-grade reading level target for all content

2. **Visual Learning Pattern**
   - Screenshots with annotations for all key interfaces
   - Diagrams to explain relationships and concepts
   - Consistent visual language throughout

3. **Practical Application Pattern**
   - Real-world examples from user personas
   - Templates based on common use cases
   - Step-by-step instructions for implementation

4. **Progressive Learning Path**
   - Basic concepts → Simple applications → Advanced implementations
   - "Just enough" information at each stage
   - Clear signposts for when to move to next level

## Output Formats
- HTML for web viewing
- PDF for download and printing
- EPUB for e-readers
- Possibly print format

## Terminology System
- Consistent glossary of terms used throughout
- Plain language alternatives for technical Tana terminology
- Visual dictionary of UI elements
