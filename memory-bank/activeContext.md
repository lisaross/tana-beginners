# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Initial project setup and planning phase
- Defining project scope and structure based on PRD
- Creating memory bank documentation for collaborative work
- Establishing GitHub workflow for content management
- Implementing "Write Useful Books" methodology for accelerated guide creation

## Recent Changes
- Created project repository
- Added Product Requirements Document (PRD.md)
- Set up memory bank structure
- Created GitHub issue tags and workflow documentation
- Defined content development workflow process
- Added "Write Useful Books" approach for reader-centric, value-focused guide

## Next Steps
1. **Define & Design Phase (1 week)**
   - Conduct 5-7 interviews with non-technical Tana users
   - Draft detailed table of contents with clear takeaways
   - Create terminology glossary with plain language alternatives
   - Design standard templates for chapters, examples, and exercises

2. **Create Core Content Phase (3 weeks)**
   - Write value-first chapters (Introduction, Getting Started, Practical Templates)
   - Develop essential screenshots and visual aids
   - Share with 5-10 beta readers for initial feedback
   - Complete first drafts of remaining chapters

3. **Development Setup**
   - Set up image directory structure
   - Create build system for multiple output formats
   - Establish version control workflow using GitHub
   - Implement accessibility validation
   - Configure GitHub project with defined labels and templates

## Active Decisions
- Determining the right balance of screenshots vs. text explanations
- Choosing the most effective plain-language alternatives for technical terms
- Selecting the optimal chapter sequence for progressive learning
- Identifying the most valuable templates for target audience
- Structuring the GitHub workflow for efficient content collaboration
- Selecting beta readers from target audience personas

## Key Considerations
- Content must remain accurate despite using simplified language
- Visual aids must add clarity without adding complexity
- Examples must be relevant to diverse user backgrounds
- Structure must support both linear reading and reference use
- System must be maintainable as Tana evolves with new features
- Content workflow must support clear tracking of progress
- GitHub process must be accessible to non-technical team members
- Early chapters must deliver immediate value to readers
- Every page should have high value-per-page ratio
