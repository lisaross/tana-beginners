# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Initial project setup and planning phase
- Defining project scope and structure based on revised PRD
- Creating memory bank documentation for collaborative work
- Establishing GitHub workflow for content management
- Implementing "Write Useful Books" methodology for accelerated guide creation
- Preparing for Define & Design phase execution

## Recent Changes
- Created project repository
- Added Product Requirements Document (PRD.md)
- Updated PRD to incorporate "Write Useful Books" methodology
- Renamed guide to "Tana Simplified: Digital Organization for Everyone"
- Set up memory bank structure
- Created GitHub issue tags and workflow documentation
- Defined content development workflow process
- Added "Write Useful Books" approach for reader-centric, value-focused guide
- Developed detailed 7-day plan for Define & Design phase

## Next Steps
1. **Define & Design Phase - Day 1-2**
   - Develop interview script for non-technical Tana users
   - Recruit 5-7 participants matching our user personas
   - Conduct user interviews to identify pain points and terminology issues
   - Document specific confusion areas and successful learning strategies

2. **Define & Design Phase - Day 3-7**
   - Analyze interview data to create pain point inventory
   - Develop detailed table of contents with clear value propositions
   - Create plain language glossary for technical terms
   - Design chapter templates and example frameworks
   - Develop persona-based scenarios that build across chapters

3. **Development Setup**
   - Set up image directory structure
   - Create build system for multiple output formats
   - Establish version control workflow using GitHub
   - Implement accessibility validation
   - Configure GitHub project with defined labels and templates

## Active Decisions
- Determining the right balance of screenshots vs. text explanations
- Choosing the most effective plain-language alternatives for technical terms
- Prioritizing chapters to front-load immediate value (Intro, Getting Started, Templates)
- Identifying the most valuable templates for target audience
- Structuring the GitHub workflow for efficient content collaboration
- Selecting beta readers from target audience personas
- Finalizing interview questions to extract maximum value from user discussions

## Key Considerations
- Content must remain accurate despite using simplified language
- Visual aids must add clarity without adding complexity
- Examples must be relevant to diverse user backgrounds
- Structure must support both linear reading and reference use
- System must be maintainable as Tana evolves with new features
- Content workflow must support clear tracking of progress
- GitHub process must be accessible to non-technical team members
- Early chapters must deliver immediate value to readers
- Every page should have high value-per-page ratio
- User interview insights should drive content prioritization
- Beta testing will occur after first three priority chapters
- Guide will incorporate structured feedback (love it/feels slow/confusing/useful)
