# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Initial project setup and planning phase
- Defining project scope and structure based on PRD
- Creating memory bank documentation for collaborative work
- Establishing GitHub workflow for content management

## Recent Changes
- Created project repository
- Added Product Requirements Document (PRD.md)
- Set up memory bank structure
- Created GitHub issue tags and workflow documentation
- Defined content development workflow process

## Next Steps
1. **Research Phase**
   - Gather existing Tana documentation and resources
   - Interview non-technical Tana users about pain points
   - Identify most challenging Tana concepts for beginners
   - Create detailed chapter outlines

2. **Content Planning**
   - Develop consistent terminology guidelines
   - Create templates for chapter structure
   - Design visual style guide for screenshots and diagrams
   - Establish user personas for examples and use cases

3. **Development Setup**
   - Set up image directory structure
   - Create build system for multiple output formats
   - Establish version control workflow using GitHub
   - Implement accessibility validation
   - Configure GitHub project with defined labels and templates

## Active Decisions
- Determining the right balance of screenshots vs. text explanations
- Choosing the most effective plain-language alternatives for technical terms
- Selecting the optimal chapter sequence for progressive learning
- Identifying the most valuable templates for target audience
- Structuring the GitHub workflow for efficient content collaboration

## Key Considerations
- Content must remain accurate despite using simplified language
- Visual aids must add clarity without adding complexity
- Examples must be relevant to diverse user backgrounds
- Structure must support both linear reading and reference use
- System must be maintainable as Tana evolves with new features
- Content workflow must support clear tracking of progress
- GitHub process must be accessible to non-technical team members
