# Project Brief: Tana Simplified

## Overview
This project aims to create a beginner-friendly guide titled "Tana Simplified: Digital Organization for Everyone" that makes the powerful knowledge management tool Tana accessible to non-technical users. By using plain language, real-world examples, and a progressive learning approach, we'll help users quickly gain value from Tana without requiring technical expertise.

## Goals
1. Create a comprehensive, jargon-free guide that enables non-technical users to become competent and confident with Tana
2. Follow the "Write Useful Books" methodology to maximize reader value and natural recommendability
3. Develop practical templates and real-world use cases that demonstrate immediate value
4. Establish a clear, progressive learning path that builds competence chapter by chapter
5. Produce a highly visual guide with annotated screenshots and diagrams
6. Deliver consistent value-per-page that drives natural recommendations among readers

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Non-technical professionals (35-55) seeking better knowledge organization
- **Secondary**: Students, researchers, and small business owners with limited technical background
- **Common trait**: Feeling overwhelmed by Tana's capabilities and terminology

## Key Features
1. Plain language explanations of Tana concepts with real-world analogies
2. Progressive disclosure of features based on practical need, not technical hierarchy
3. Value-first chapter structure delivering immediate utility to readers
4. Ready-to-use templates for common use cases (project management, research, etc.)
5. Step-by-step tutorials with clear visual guidance
6. Troubleshooting sections addressing common user challenges
7. Exercises and practice scenarios to reinforce learning

## Success Criteria
1. **Primary metric**: Natural recommendation rate among early readers (>75%)
2. **Secondary metrics**:
   - Average reader able to complete basic tasks after first chapter (>90%)
   - User engagement with provided templates (>80% usage)
   - Reported confidence increase with Tana (2+ point improvement on 5-point scale)
3. Reader feedback reporting clarity, usefulness, and confidence improvement
4. Successful completion of guided exercises with minimal frustration

## Constraints
1. Must maintain accuracy despite Tana's evolving feature set
2. Must accommodate readers with varying levels of general technical proficiency
3. Must be accessible across different formats (PDF, web, print)
4. Must be structured for easy updates as Tana evolves

## Development Approach
1. User-centered design with extensive interviews and beta testing
2. Iterative development focusing on delivering maximum value per page
3. "Write Useful Books" methodology to drive structure and content
