**Subject: Help Create "Tana Simplified: Digital Organization for Everyone" - Looking for Non-Technical Users to Interview**

Hello Tana Community!

I'm creating a guide called **"Tana Simplified: Digital Organization for Everyone"** aimed at making Tana more accessible to non-technical users. My goal is to create a resource that explains Tana in plain language with practical examples and templates.

### I Need Your Help!

I'm looking to interview **6-7 Tana users who don't have a technical background** to understand:
- What was confusing when you first started with Tana
- How you eventually figured things out
- What would have made your learning experience better

**The ideal participants are:**
- People who use Tana for business, school, or personal organization
- Those who don't have programming or technical backgrounds
- Users who remember their early struggles with Tana
- Both new users and those who have become comfortable with the basics

### What's Involved?
- A 30-minute Zoom conversation
- Share your honest experiences and challenges
- No preparation needed - just your experiences!
- **Benefit: Early access to the guide and acknowledgment in the final publication**

### Specifically looking for people who match these profiles:
1. **Business professionals** using Tana for client/project management
2. **Students or researchers** using Tana for study or research organization
3. **Small business owners** or individuals managing personal information
