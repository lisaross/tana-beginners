# Define & Design Plan - Week 1

This document outlines the detailed plan for the first week of our accelerated 8-week "Tana for Real People" guide development using the "Write Useful Books" methodology.

## Day 1-2: Interview Preparation & Execution

### Interview Script Development
1. **Core Questions:**
   - "What specific tasks in Tana do you find most confusing?"
   - "When you first started, what concept took longest to understand?"
   - "What would have helped you get productive faster?"
   - "What daily tasks do you use Tana for most?"
   - "What analogies helped you understand Tana concepts?"
   - "What templates or setups would have saved you time?"
   - "Where did existing documentation fall short for you?"
   - "What was your 'aha moment' with Tana, if any?"

2. **Follow-up Probes:**
   - "Can you give me a specific example of when that was confusing?"
   - "What words or terms were unclear to you?"
   - "How did you eventually figure it out?"
   - "What would you tell a friend who's just starting with Tana?"

### Participant Recruitment
1. **Target Users:**
   - 2 users matching "Sarah" persona (marketing/business professionals)
   - 2 users matching "Mark" persona (students/researchers)
   - 2 users matching "Elena" persona (small business owners/low-tech users)
   - 1 Tana community helper who assists beginners

2. **Recruitment Methods:**
   - Post in Tana community forum/Discord
   - Direct outreach to users who've posted "help" questions
   - Request referrals to non-technical users
   - Offer preview access to the guide as incentive

### Interview Execution
1. **Format:**
   - 30-minute Zoom sessions
   - Record with permission
   - Share screen to show Tana interface during discussion
   - Take detailed notes on specific pain points and terminology

2. **Key Areas to Observe:**
   - Language used to describe Tana concepts
   - Hesitation when explaining workflows
   - Workarounds for limitations or confusion
   - Emotional responses to features (frustration, excitement)

## Day 3: Pain Point Analysis

### Data Synthesis
1. **Create Pain Point Inventory:**
   - List all mentioned pain points
   - Count frequency of each issue
   - Rate severity (1-5) based on user impact
   - Note specific terminologies that caused confusion

2. **Task Success Analysis:**
   - Identify tasks users struggle to complete
   - Map the conceptual barriers for each task
   - Document successful learning paths

3. **Terminology Mapping:**
   - Catalog technical terms users misunderstood
   - Note alternative words users suggested or used
   - Identify metaphors or analogies that worked

### Outcome Mapping
1. **Define Success Outcomes:**
   - Create "before and after" scenarios for each major pain point
   - Define measurable success criteria (e.g., "User can create a linked reference in under 30 seconds")
   - Prioritize outcomes by impact on user productivity

2. **Group Related Outcomes:**
   - Cluster outcomes by related concepts
   - Identify natural teaching sequences
   - Map dependencies between skills

## Day 4: Table of Contents & Takeaways

### Detailed Chapter Structure
1. **Chapter Outline Development:**
   - Review 10 chapters from PRD
   - Refine based on interview insights
   - Define clear scope for each chapter
   - Establish progression of concepts

2. **Chapter Outcomes:**

   - Define clear "value promise" for each section
   - Create "before/after" scenarios that demonstrate value

3. **Value-First Organization:**
   - Ensure Chapter 1 delivers immediate "aha" moments
   - Design Chapter 2 to get readers productive within one hour
   - Make Chapter 5 (templates) immediately applicable to real problems
   - Place quick wins strategically throughout content

### Section-Level Planning
1. **Section Breakdown:**
   - Divide each chapter into 3-5 logical sections
   - Define clear purpose for each section
   - Create consistent pattern: Problem → Solution → Example → Try This

2. **Value-Per-Page Analysis:**
   - Map high-value insights throughout content
   - Ensure no "desert" sections without practical takeaways
   - Front-load value in each chapter

## Day 5: Terminology & Language Framework
