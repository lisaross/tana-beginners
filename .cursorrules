# Cursor Rules for Tana Simplified: Digital Organization for Everyone

## Project Patterns

### Content Style
- Use plain, conversational language (8th-grade reading level)
- Avoid technical jargon; when necessary, introduce with plain language explanations
- Use real-world analogies to explain complex concepts
- Break complex processes into clear, numbered steps
- Include "Try This" exercises to reinforce concepts

### Terminology Preferences
- Prefer "item" or "bullet point" over "node" when possible
- Use "tag" instead of "supertag" for initial explanations
- Compare "references" to "tagging someone in a photo"
- Avoid technical terms like "graph," "bidirectional," or "database"

### Visual Standards
- Screenshots should be annotated with clear labels
- Use consistent visual markers (colors, shapes) for UI elements
- Include "before and after" examples for key operations
- Diagrams should be simple and focus on relationships

### Content Structure
- Each chapter follows progression: concept → example → try it → build on it
- Paragraphs limited to 3-4 sentences for readability
- Use headers, lists, and tables to organize information
- Include cross-references to related concepts

### User-Centered Approach
- Each concept should connect to a real-world use case
- Examples should represent diverse user needs (students, professionals, personal)
- Templates should be immediately usable without modification
- Troubleshooting sections address common user challenges
